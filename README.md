# Delphi Tools
### 1) [Install Library Paths]
- Install many library paths in Delphi IDE in all platforms in one click
- You can also use the key ($Platform) in the path, which the program will replace with the name of each platform
- The paths that you have used will be saved in the file install_paths.ini in the same path of the tool. So every time you use this tool, you do not need to enter all the paths again
